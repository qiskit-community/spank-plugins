# SPANK Plugin for QRUN

This is [SPANK plugin](https://slurm.schedmd.com/spank.html) to setup [QRUN](../../commands/qrun/README.md) command runtime by parsing --q-backend/--q-primitive options in their Slurm script and set environment variables required to run QRUN as Slurm tasks.
 
## Prerequisites

* CMake
* gcc


## How to build

```shell-session
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

In addition, add the following 1 line to the /etc/slurm/plugstack.conf on the nodes where this plugin is installed.

```bash
optional /usr/lib64/slurm/spank_ibm_qrun.so
```
