# Python examples for Sampler/Estimator primitives with IBM Direct Access QRMI

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or 3.12
* [Installation of QRMI python package(`qrmi`)](../../../../qrmi/README.md)
* [Installation of QRMI primitives python package(`qrmi-primitives`)](../../../../README.md)

## Install dependencies

Assuming your python virtual environment is located at `~/py311venv_qrmi_primitives/bin/activate`,

```shell-session
$ source ~/py311venv_qrmi_primitives/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set environment variables

Because QRMI is an environment variable driven software library, all configuration parameters must be specified in environment variables. The required environment variables are listed below. This example assumes that a `.env` file is available under the current directory.

| Environment variables | Descriptions |
| ---- | ---- |
| QRMI_RESOURCE_ID | Quantum backend name(e.g. `ibm_torino`) |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_ENDPOINT | Direct Access endpoint URL |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_IAM_ENDPOINT | IBM Cloud IAM endpoint URL(e.g. `https://iam.cloud.ibm.com`) |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_IAM_APIKEY | IBM Cloud IAM API Key |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_SERVICE_CRN | Cloud Resource Name(CRN) of the provisioned Direct Access instance, starting with `crn:v1:`. |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | AWS Access Key ID to access S3 bucket |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS Secret Access Key to access S3 bucket |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_S3_ENDPOINT | S3 endpoint URL |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_S3_BUCKET | S3 bucket name |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_S3_REGION | S3 bucket region name(e.g. `us-east`) |
| QRMI_IBM_DA_TIMEOUT_SECONDS | Time (in seconds) after which job should time out and get cancelled. It is based on system execution time (not wall clock time). System execution time is the amount of time that the system is dedicated to processing your job. |

## How to run

### SamplerV2

```shell-session
$ python sampler.py
```

### EstimatorV2

```shell-session
$ python estimator.py
```
